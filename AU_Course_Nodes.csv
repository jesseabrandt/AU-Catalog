HNRS-395 Theories of Inquiry (3) opens a new window," HNRS-395 Theories of Inquiry (3)The many paths to creating knowledge begin with asking a good question and a willingness to take some risks. This process of producing and presenting knowledge is called inquiry. All inquiry begins with a problem, puzzle, or question and seeks to address, solve, or answer it in a way that is compelling for audiences. Different traditions of inquiry approach this process in different ways, fitting questions to methods according to different principles and structuring the process in order to achieve different outcomes. At the same time, traditions of inquiry are not entirely exclusive; they are, rather, engaged in an ongoing scholarly dialogue, and feature subtle overlaps and complementarities. In this course AU Honors students navigate this complexity while formulating plans for their own research, creative, or professional activities. What they learn in this course feeds directly into their other classes, Honors colloquia, and capstone. Students also take these lessons with them into the world beyond the university. The course helps students grapple with the difficulties of identifying a strong question to inaugurate a process of inquiry, how to refine the question in dialogue with different research traditions, and then how to identify and locate the right material and methods for answering the question.

PHIL-236 Ecological Justice: Ethics in a More-Than-Human World (3) opens a new window," PHIL-236 Ecological Justice: Ethics in a More-Than-Human World (3)This course is an in-depth study of ecological justice, that is, ethics in a more-than-human world. It tackles the question of how environmental justice intersects with social justice, especially along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, and disability. It begins with classic environmental literature, in order to interrogate the traditional (and yet changing) referents of the term “nature,” from animals and wilderness, to urban parks and chic products. It then explores the ways in which marginalized populations (especially women, people of color, queer people, and people with disabilities) have not only borne the brunt of environmental devastation and climate change, but have also historically led environmental justice movements around the globe. Throughout the course, students dig deeper to understand the conceptual underpinnings of environmental and social injustices. In particular, philosophical tools are used to critically assess how the notion of “natural” has been used to describe forms of life that are socially naturalized (e.g., white, cisheterosexual, able-bodied people) and similarly, how the notion of “unnatural” has been used to describe the socially marginalized (e.g., the queer, the immigrant, the impaired, etc.). Drawing on the traditions of ecofeminism, race and environmental justice, queer ecology, and disability theory, students learn that a robust environmental ethics must reimagine “nature” itself to address degrading ecosystems alongside social hierarchies and marginalization. Students deepen their knowledge of intersectional justice not only across human communities, but within a more-than-human world.

PHIL-416 Feminist Philosophy (3) opens a new window," PHIL-416 Feminist Philosophy (3)Posing questions about what we can know, how we perceive, and how we experience our bodies and interactions with the world is arguably a central preoccupation of philosophy. Canonical works such as the Confessions of Augustine and Rousseau, Descartes’ vivid first-person account of his quest for certainty, Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological investigation of embodied experience, and Sartre’s existentialist study of “the gaze” have historically placed narrative investigation of the nature of human experience at the center of the philosophical project. One way to understand the distinctive contribution of feminist philosophers and theorists of the late twentieth century is to see that body of work as telling another side of the story, one that radically recasts conceptions of embodiment, identity, ethics, and the body politic. This course focuses on feminist approaches to enduring philosophical questions, to which is added the larger question of difference not limited to that of gender or sex.Crosslist: PHIL-616 .Prerequisite: one PHIL course.  | ",PHIL,416,Feminist Philosophy,3,3,,,,PHIL-416

RELG-245 Stories of South Asia (3) opens a new window," RELG-245 Stories of South Asia (3)Storytelling is a time-honored tradition in South Asia, where tales of adventure and intrigue, such as those told in epic poems, allegorical fables, and parodic chronicles, have survived and thrived for centuries. Among the most popular topics of these persistent narratives are the struggles and successes of political actors in ancient and medieval India, whose efforts underlie the ethics impinging on the most pressing societal issues affecting South Asia today. In order to understand these modern political ethical problems better, this course identifies their ideological roots by delving into collections of stories that represent the politically charged genres of epic, allegory, and parody. In addition to examining the contents of these literary texts closely and situating them in their sociohistorical contexts, students consider how the texts’ implicit teachings continue to resonate even now on the Indian subcontinent and its surrounding areas, where political unity and stability in any respect can be precarious.AU Core Habits of Mind: Socio-Historical Inquiry.  | ",RELG,245,Stories of South Asia,3,3,,,,RELG-245

The differences in global economic conditions have led scholars to assert that the developmental state model is no longer viable. This course investigates what created the economic miracles of China and Vietnam, and earlier Malaysia, and whether the basic principles of the developmental state model still apply; is state intervention obsolete, possible, or necessary in the twenty-first century global economy. The class then contrasts the East and Southeast Asian models with India, an emerging economy and one that in the past was seen as a failed developmental state, and concludes by trying to find lessons with wider applicability for developing countries.Grading: A-F only. | ",SISU,312,"Governance, Development, and Security in Asia ",3,3,,A-F only,,SISU-312

LING-601 Sounds of Language and Their Meaning (3) opens a new window," LING-601 Sounds of Language and Their Meaning (3)This course introduces the study of sound and its meaning in human language. It examines phonetics and phonology, the areas of linguistics that address how speech sounds are made, used, heard, and mentally organized, and their connections to language in social identity and society more broadly. The course covers essential aspects of how people speak, both in terms of the physical production of the sounds of speech, and in terms of different languages and dialects. Students explore what the sounds of language mean: how sounds convey both communicative meaning (such as the difference between pen and pin in English, or caro and carro in Spanish) and social meaning related to identity and stereotypes. Students learn the basic properties and classification of speech sounds and gain an introduction to sociolinguistic diversity, with extensions into related areas such as language learning and how languages change over time.Crosslist: LING-401 .  | ",LING,601,Sounds of Language and Their Meaning,3,3,,,,LING-601
LING-602 Words and Language Structure (3) opens a new window," LING-602 Words and Language Structure (3)This course provides familiarity with various morphological systems that occur in world languages, and examines topics that arise from looking at the shape of words. Students explore what a word is; the meaning of any linguistic unit between two spaces in mental grammar; the connection between morphology and phonology as well as words to syntax and semantics. Student also consider whether deeper principles underly the basic structure and shape of words, and whether these principles are related to what happens in language as a whole. By analyzing morphological patterns in different languages, they understand important theoretical issues connected with morphology and their implication for linguistic theory.Crosslist: LING-402 .  | ",LING,602,Words and Language Structure,3,3,,,,LING-602
LING-603 Sociohistorical Linguistics (3) opens a new window," LING-603 Sociohistorical Linguistics (3)The study of historical linguistics is the lens through which linguists attempt to uncover what appear to be mysterious and random occurrences, but are in fact the result of codified language change. With the application of the comparative method, students learn how languages change and how change is in part affected by external sociohistorical factors. Students work on a language of their choice and explore solving linguistic puzzles. English language examples of these puzzles include ‘I do’ vs ‘she does,’ ‘children’ vs ‘childs,’ and the pronunciation of ‘enough’ vs ‘through.’ Students learn that these inconsistencies are the result of just ordinary and rather typical universal phenomena that affect all world languages.Crosslist: LING-403 .  | ",LING,603,Sociohistorical Linguistics,3,3,,,,LING-603

Students explore how society affects language use at all levels of linguistic structure (from pronunciations, to conversations, to entire languages), and how everyday speech and its social perception interacts with systems of power, prejudice and opportunity. They examine how language correlates with social groupings and identities, and how these are perceived and imagined, taking on a life of their own in broader society and the media. Students also examine how language is used to construct gendered and racial/ethnic identities, define social roles and power relations, and socialize children. Students become familiar with key sociolinguistic and linguistic anthropological theories and methodologies, and gain experience in data collection and analysis.Crosslist: LING-420 .  | ",LING,620,Language in Society,3,3,,,,LING-620

This course introduces raciolinguistic perspectives, a topic at the intersection of linguistics, anthropology, ethnic studies, and education. It is particularly relevant to Latinx issues and Spanish given their prominence in U.S. immigration and educational debates, and language discrimination’s important but often invisible role in perpetuating social hegemony for racialized multilingual minorities. It explores language’s role in race and ethnicity construction in the United States and related topics such as power, resistance, representation, and xenophobia. The course also discusses in-group diversity, colorism, and other related issues. While the course centers Latinx issues, it draws comparisons with the linguistic depiction of other minoritized groups such as African Americans, Asian Americans, and Arab Americans.Crosslist: LING-421  and LTST-421 .

"LIT-683 Technological Imaginations: Past, Present, and Future (3) opens a new window"," LIT-683 Technological Imaginations: Past, Present, and Future (3)This course explores the meanings of technology in the broad sense of the word’s origins in the Greek “techne”: things people make, from tools, craft, art and artifice, to the complex technologies that permeate the world today. Students examine how various historical periods grappled with the hopes and anxieties generated by new crafts, new technologies, and new art forms. Within the long history of emerging technological imaginaries, the course studies their relationship to specific material cultures and conditions. The phonetic Greek alphabet, for instance, gave rise to the written and performed tragedies that in turn gave expression to ideas debated within the polis. Technologies of reproduction and circulation thus stabilize and perpetuate the texts a culture deems foundational to its understanding of itself: techne as artistic craft cannot exist without the techne of material reproducibility. Engaging with the historical archive and historical texts develops valuable research skills, connects with key moments of excitement, invention, and change, and provides essential context to today’s debates about emerging arts, technologies, and social practices.  | ",LIT,683,"Technological Imaginations: Past, Present, and Future ",3,3,,,,LIT-683

PHIL-616 Feminist Philosophy (3) opens a new window," PHIL-616 Feminist Philosophy (3)Posing questions about what we can know, how we perceive, and how we experience our bodies and interactions with the world is arguably a central preoccupation of philosophy. Canonical works such as the Confessions of Augustine and Rousseau, Descartes’ vivid first-person account of his quest for certainty, Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological investigation of embodied experience, and Sartre’s existentialist study of “the gaze” have historically placed narrative investigation of the nature of human experience at the center of the philosophical project. One way to understand the distinctive contribution of feminist philosophers and theorists of the late twentieth century is to see that body of work as telling another side of the story, one that radically recasts conceptions of embodiment, identity, ethics, and the body politic. This course focuses on feminist approaches to enduring philosophical questions, to which is added the larger question of difference not limited to that of gender or sex.Crosslist: PHIL-416 .  | ",PHIL,616,Feminist Philosophy,3,3,,,,PHIL-616
