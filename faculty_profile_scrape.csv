I also have two relatively new interests. (1) Non-Buddhist contemplative practices. Many ancient traditions have forms of contemplation, and those outside the Buddhist tradition seem to me understudied. My student Milly Curlee and I have a first paper on the Ignatian Examen, an exercise developed by Catholicism’s Jesuits, accepted into press at Journal of Positive Psychology. (2) Moral psychology: (a) I have become interested in the integration of social cognitive theory and virtue theory. A grant is permitting me to do initial empirical work on this topic. A previous grant from the Templeton Foundation allowed me to write a paper, published in Social and Personality Psychology Compass, arguing for that integration. (b) My student Ryan Smout and I are beginning to study the consequences arising from witnessing others violating our sense of morality.

Current or recent projects include:

1) Urban trees and cooling. We have a bike-mounted air temperature sensor to assess the spatial variability in urban heat here in DC. We also use this data as collected by cars in many other cities around the country to examine the relationship between tree canopy, paved surfaces, and heat.

2) Urban tree response to heat part I. We have assembled hundreds of high-resolution satellite images per year to monitor the timing of green-up in the spring and leaf loss in the fall for every tree in DC. These ""phenological"" measurements are a window into tree response to climate change.

3) Urban tree response to heat part II. We fly drones with thermal cameras over trees in urban areas to estimate tree transpiration during hot times of year and hot times of each day. Are trees changing their transpiration patterns in response to ever warmer conditions?

4) The rise of the boreal forest shrub. Shrubs in Alaska are getting very large and now comprise a substantial portion of carbon storage in that region. They are rarely accounted for. We are using drone and aerial imagery to gather new measurements.

5) Software for land cover change. We have developed and released a cool tool for monitoring land cover change anywhere on earth from 1984 to present on near monthly basis. One can, for example, study urban growth patterns, forest loss, or land abandonment. Students can use this tool to address their own research questions.",

I also have two relatively new interests. (1) Non-Buddhist contemplative practices. Many ancient traditions have forms of contemplation, and those outside the Buddhist tradition seem to me understudied. My student Milly Curlee and I have a first paper on the Ignatian Examen, an exercise developed by Catholicism’s Jesuits, accepted into press at Journal of Positive Psychology. (2) Moral psychology: (a) I have become interested in the integration of social cognitive theory and virtue theory. A grant is permitting me to do initial empirical work on this topic. A previous grant from the Templeton Foundation allowed me to write a paper, published in Social and Personality Psychology Compass, arguing for that integration. (b) My student Ryan Smout and I are beginning to study the consequences arising from witnessing others violating our sense of morality.

1) Urban trees and cooling. We have a bike-mounted air temperature sensor to assess the spatial variability in urban heat here in DC. We also use this data as collected by cars in many other cities around the country to examine the relationship between tree canopy, paved surfaces, and heat.

2) Urban tree response to heat part I. We have assembled hundreds of high-resolution satellite images per year to monitor the timing of green-up in the spring and leaf loss in the fall for every tree in DC. These ""phenological"" measurements are a window into tree response to climate change.

3) Urban tree response to heat part II. We fly drones with thermal cameras over trees in urban areas to estimate tree transpiration during hot times of year and hot times of each day. Are trees changing their transpiration patterns in response to ever warmer conditions?

4) The rise of the boreal forest shrub. Shrubs in Alaska are getting very large and now comprise a substantial portion of carbon storage in that region. They are rarely accounted for. We are using drone and aerial imagery to gather new measurements.

5) Software for land cover change. We have developed and released a cool tool for monitoring land cover change anywhere on earth from 1984 to present on near monthly basis. One can, for example, study urban growth patterns, forest loss, or land abandonment. Students can use this tool to address their own research questions.",

Within this broad area of inquiry, my present work explores the collision of Black-led movements for social, political, and economic transformation with state infrastructures of militarized policing, surveillance, and imprisonment. I analyze the productivity of this collision; how it gives rise to new formations of knowledge, subjectivity, intimacy, gender, organization, and statecraft across time and space. I ask: how do Black radical demands generated within and against US prisons presage alternative futures for people and places on both sides of prison walls? In what ways have state-organized responses to these demands - via diverse configurations of repression, reform, and incorporation – been key drivers of US historical development and state formation? Through what bureaucratic, ideological, and material processes is this dynamic political struggle transformed into an administrative problem of “criminal justice”? How can conceptualizing the US prison as a domain of war open new analytical, theoretical, and methodological terrain?

Omi earned a PhD in Dance from Temple University with a specialization in the development of contemporary dance in Senegal, and an MFA in Dance from Arizona State University with a focus on contemporary African dance techniques and somatic approaches to choreography. She is one of 16 people certified in the practice and pedagogy of Germaine Acogny’s Modern African Dance Technique. Omi’s scholarly research focuses on continuities across African American, Caribbean and Francophone African cultural histories. Additional areas of specialization include 20th century black modernism in Jamaica, the United States and Francophone Africa, African independence-era politics and the performing arts, Négritude and African socialisms, Africana and ‘Black’ feminisms, and embodiment in dance. Her movement research employs choreographic tools to explore connections between language, rhythm, symbolism and aesthetics in African social and contemporary dances.

In her current book project, Putting Africa in Her Place: Germaine Acogny’s Modern African Dance Technique, Omi engages a new pan-African theoretical framework to examine cultural and ideological values embedded within the Acogny Technique. Her theoretical model, Awòdá, explores relationships between the body, ideologies, aesthetics and culture through African and Diaspora embodied practice. As a Fulbright Scholar to Guinea, Omi apprenticed with Les Ballets Africains, the country’s national dance company. She is currently developing a digital humanities project that investigates the company’s development in relationship to the country’s turbulent political history. Omi has taught widely in West African and US institutions, including the University of Richmond, Virginia Commonwealth University, the University of Minnesota, L’Institut Supérieur des Arts Mory Kante in Dubréka, Guinea and L'École des Sables Centre International de Danses Traditionnelles et Contemporaines in Toubab Dialaw, Senegal. She was recently awarded a commendation from the US Senate in recognition of her Fulbright research.

Omi is the founder and artistic director of omi davis co, a dance-based organization with a network of artists based in the US and West Africa. omi davis co promotes intercultural exchange through international travel and dance education, hosting an annual Dance in Africa workshop in Senegal each summer.

We have two active areas of research in our laboratory.

(1) The first area of research investigates one specific signaling pathway defect and how it predisposes to squamous cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer. The tumor progression locus 2 (Tpl2) gene is involved in a variety of cellular functions including inflammatory processes and immune function. We have recently identified a novel tumor suppressor role of Tpl2 in chemically-induced skin cancer. Tpl2-/-mice have higher incidences of cutaneous papillomas than wildtype mice and these papillomas convert to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma more readily than in wildtype mice. Currently, we are working to understand the stromal-epithelial interactions that drive skin cancer development and progression in Tpl2-/- mice.

(2) Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer in the United States. Epidemiological studies have identified obesity as a risk factor for multiple myeloma. Obesity increases both the risk of developing multiple myeloma and decreases overall patient survival. However, the molecular underpinnings by which adipocytes (fat cells) contribute to multiple myeloma growth and progression is relatively unknown. Our laboratory is working to understand the hormonal, lipid, and signaling factor dysregulation in obese adipocytes that contribute to MM growth and progression.",

His first monograph, ""The Lost German East: Forced Migration and the Politics of Memory, 1945-1970"" (Cambridge University Press, 2012) examines how, amid the charged political context of the early Cold War, millions of West Germans expelled from the province of Silesia after World War II came to recognize that physical return was not possible.

A fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (2014-2015) supported work on three further book projects. His second monograph, ""Demolition on Karl Marx Square: Cultural Barbarism and the People’s State in 1968"" (Oxford University Press, 2017) looks at how the 1968 demolition of Leipzig’s medieval University Church brought about an essential turning point in relations between Communist authorities and the people they claimed to serve amid the largest East German protest between the 1953 Uprising and 1989 Revolution.

His third monograph, ""Bowling for Communism: Urban Ingenuity at the End of East Germany"" (Cornell University Press, 2020), combines archival reading with oral history to explore local civic initiative at the official and public levels to ""save"" Leipzig from the bureaucratic obstructionism from central authorities in Berlin. The book measures how catastrophic urban decay helped to prompt dynamic interplay between residents, local officials, and central authorities over the decade before Leipzigers spearheaded the revolution that ended East German communism in 1989.

His fourth book, ""Three Cities after Hitler: Redemptive Reconstruction across Cold War Borders"" (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2021), measures the politics of memory in urban reconstruction under three contrasting regime ideologies haunted by the recent Nazi past. Weaving back together a common narrative, it compares post-1945 urban planning in three cities which had been part of united Germany before 1945 and were then divided by Cold War borders -- Frankfurt (West Germany), Leipzig (East Germany), and Wrocław (western Poland).

Professor Demshuk's courses feature twentieth-century Central and Eastern Europe, with close attention nationalism, genocide and ethnic cleansing, urban planning and memory, ecological devastation, and the broader effects of mid-20th-century forced migration on the world we inhabit today.

Conscious of the current politics of ending coal dependency, his current research compares grassroots ecology surrounding the coal pits of former East and West Germany. How did local populations respond as villages in the East and West were destroyed to make way for the moonscape of lignite mining and processing, and how did recultivation planning and outcomes succeed or fail during and after Cold War division? Professor Demshuk is also pursuing a micro-historical analysis of the so-called ""filthiest village in Europe"". Immediately downwind from the belching smokestacks of the Espenhain coal refinery (one of Europe’s worst polluters), the East German village of Mölbis became a symbol for reform through the last decade of East Germany, and then a symbol of hope for a better future after German Reunification. Through close, local-level analysis based on diverse archives, private collections, and interviews, Professor Demshuk further excavates the complex dynamics of state-civic relations under East German rule, investigating the grassroots initiatives that helped to both end communist “democratic centralism”, as well as usher in many successful aspects of German Reunification.",

Anthropology. CUNY Graduate Center;MPhil. Anthropology. CUNY Graduate Center;MA. Sociology. Central European University;BA. Philosophy. Bard College;;,"My research focuses on issues of security, war, cities, postcolonialism and racial capitalism in East Africa. My current project is a study of the war on terror in Kenya, examining how counterterrorism permeates many facets of social and political life, transforming institutions and social relations. I have also written academic and public scholarship on piracy in the Indian Ocean, the securitization of refugee governance in East Africa, student activism in North America, and the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City. Additionally, I am an Editor of the journal, Focaal: A Journal of Global and Historical Anthropology.

The book I am completing is titled, ""The Long War on Terror: Decolonization and Recolonization in Kenya"" and examines the colonial origins of counterterrorism, the shifting terrain of activism in the aftermath of terrorist attacks, and the transformation of the postcolonial state and cities under the auspice of the war on terror. As an ethnography of social transformation, the project traces the ways in which social relations, urban spaces, frontier zones, state institutions and struggles for social justice have been re-shaped by the war on terror in Kenya over the past two decades.

My second major research project is tentatively titled, Ecological Apartheid: Security and the Governance of Nature in East Africa, and investigates how the interlocking crises around poaching, drought and rangeland collapse have created the conditions for the security-driven governance of East Africa’s ‘natural spaces.’ Through the prism of political ecology, this project will analyze the “securitization of nature” in wildlife conservancies in East Africa and the social conflicts which arise in the wake of such securitization.

Thirdly, I have an ongoing stream of research on piracy, Indian Ocean governance and the production of maritime space. I have been conducting research these subjects since 2010, beginning with a study of the piracy trials in Mombasa and continuing with historical research on primitive accumulation and long histories of counter-piracy in the Indian Ocean.

My writings have appeared in American Anthropologist, Anthropological Theory, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, Anthropology Now, Cultural Anthropology (online), The Berkeley Journal of Sociology, Waging Nonviolence, Alternet, USA Today and N+1 as well as in several edited volumes.",

Her research on social systems' evolution explores how social groups maintain cohesion, process information, and perform collective computations, despite conflicts of interest between their members. To study these phenomena, she develops and analyzes mathematical models inspired by biological systems, grounded in empirical data, and using methods from a number of fields, including stochastic calculus, dynamical systems, evolutionary game theory, and information theory. Collectives and social groups can be found at all biological scales, from the neurons making up a brain to complex human societies.

Currently he studies symmetry, topology and control in low-dimensional ultracold atomic systems. These physical systems are at the ragged edge where there is just enough symmetry to find exact solutions and precise control. Any less symmetry and the system descends from the order of cosmos into the disorder of chaos.

How do these meanings inform action? What role does meaning making play in facilitating or inhibiting racial inequality?

Motivated by these questions, she has studied a range of sites and populations, including an ethnoracially diverse community health organization, the multiracial population in the U.S., and a bottle and can redemption center frequented by unhoused workers. By investigating taken-for-granted assumptions about the nature of race, work, and identity, her work aims to strengthen institutional efforts to combat inequality.




Ongoing research projects study: 1) race in the college essay production process after the federal ban on race-conscious admissions, 2) how organizations make decisions around sustainable procurement, including social criteria (e.g., purchasing from minority-owned businesses), and 3) how officials at the U.S. census produced racial meanings over time. She is also working on her first book project, Reckoning with Race which ethnographically examines how a community health organization conceptualized race across its various domains of work.

Her research is published in Genealogy, Demography, and the Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, with funding from the Antiracist Research and Policy Center, Russell Sage Foundation, Center for Environment, Equity, and Community (CECE), National Science Foundation, the Social Science Research Council, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. In 2022, she received the Outstanding Teaching Award from NYU’s College of Arts and Sciences.

A New York native, he received his Ph.D. from Rutgers University in 1984. He was active in the Civil Rights and anti-Vietnam War movements and remains active in antiwar and nuclear abolition efforts. In 1995, he founded American University’s Nuclear Studies Institute. That year, on the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombings, his Institute co-hosted a major exhibit with the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which displayed many of the artifacts that were originally supposed to be part of the Smithsonian’s ill-fated Enola Gay exhibit. Every summer, since 1995, he has taken Institute students on a study-abroad class in Kyoto, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki. The Institute was named the most creative and innovative summer program in North America by the North American Association of Summer Sessions. In 2003, Kuznick organized a group of scholars, writers, artists, clergy, and activists to protest the Smithsonian's celebratory display of the Enola Gay at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum annex.

Park is Professor and Department Chair of Philosophy and Religion at American University. She also served as the Founding Director of the Asian Studies Program from 2013 to 2020. Park specializes in East Asian Buddhism, Buddhist and comparative ethics, intercultural philosophy, and modern East Asian philosophy. Her research focuses on gender, violence, the politics of discrimination, and narrative philosophy. Marginality has been a consistent theme in her work, addressing the marginalization of the non-West and non-Western philosophy, women’s philosophy, and alternative forms of philosophizing. Her scholarship seeks to reveal power structures in philosophy and aims to amplify the voices of those at the margins.

Park has served as the President of the American Academy of Religion, the North American Korean Philosophy Association and the Society for Asian and Comparative Philosophy.

Park’s research in Buddhism focuses on the Zen and Huayan schools of East Asian Buddhism, with particular attention to issues of language, violence, and ethics. In her comparative studies, she engages Zen and Huayan Buddhism alongside postmodern thought in Continental philosophy, with a special focus on Jacques Derrida’s deconstruction.

Park’s research on modern East Asian philosophy explores the emergence of philosophy in East Asia and the East-West encounter during this period.

In her monograph Buddhism and Postmodernity: Zen, Huayan, and the Possibility of Buddhist-Postmodern Ethics (2008), Park discusses Buddhism and continental philosophy on the topics of, among others, self, language, and violence. In this book, Park offers the ""ethics of tension"" as a potential ethical paradigm drawn from Buddhism and postmodern philosophy.

Reflections of a Zen Buddhist Nun (2014), is a translation of a book published in Korean in 1960 by Kim Iryŏp (1896-1971), a writer, first-generation Korean feminist, Buddhist nun, and philosopher. In this book, Kim Iryŏp offers a creative interpretation of Buddhist philosophy and practice.

In Women and Buddhist Philosophy: Engaging Zen Master Kim Iryop (2017), Park proposes a new mode of philosophizing based on the discussion of Kim Iryŏp’s life and philosophy.

Park is also the editor of volumes: Buddhisms and Deconstructions (2006), Merleau-Ponty and Buddhism (co-edited, 2009), Comparative Political Theory and Cross-Cultural Philosophy (2009), and Makers of Modern Korean Buddhism (2010).",

Without understanding our body, we cannot understand our self.

Ongoing projects:
(participant recruitment ongoing: http://IdentityResearch.Info)

Gender Affirmation: Expectations and Satisfaction
Physical affirmation procedures facilitate the embodiment of one’s ‘self’, one’s identify. To what degree does successful gender affirmation require more than a medically successful intervention? As the number of individuals identifying as transgender has increased so too has individuals’ ability to access procedures to physically affirm their gender, with more and different types of venues participating. It is unclear whether, under these conditions, individuals’ post-procedure expectations are being met and if not, what consequences it might have. The primary goal of this project is to explore trans feminine adults’ experience physically affirming their gender, to ascertain how expectations about procedures are established and the relationship between fulfillment of expectations and individuals’ post-procedure satisfaction. Using semi-structured interviews, we are exploring the experience of trans feminine adults who had had one or more affirmation procedures over the past five years.

The Experience of Asexuality: Its complicated
Sexual attraction can be understood both as an evolved trait and an experience that is strongly influenced by our environment and experience. The number of individuals identifying as asexual has risen significantly in recent years, especially among young women. At this point we don’t know to what to degree this represents a shift in reporting (e.g., increased social acceptance and sexual awareness) or an increase in individuals not feeling sexual attraction. Nor is it clear if asexuality is best understood as a neutral state (i.e., a pattern of attraction or sexual orientation) or reflects a level of distress. Our preliminary data suggest that there are a range of experiences among those under the asexual umbrella and that how individuals report “not-feeling-sexual-attraction” may reflect important differences in their experience. Using anonymous online surveys, the goal of our research is to learn more about the self-reported experience of individuals who “do-not-feel-sexual-attraction”. In particular, we want to gain a better understanding of the ‘quality of life’ anchors for life with little or no sexual behavior and less engagement in sexual or romantic relationships.

Embodying our Sex/Gender
To social scientists, gender is connected to an individual’s sex mostly through socially constructed links. To natural scientists, it is partially that and partially a flexible behavioral trait that evolved because it facilitated obtaining high quality mates and maximizing one’s reproductive success as either an egg or sperm donor. How do we use what we know from both of these fields to better understand and support the complex experience of sex/gender? For this study we are exploring the relationships among sex, sexuality, and body to better understand why and how individuals desire to modify their bodies to align with their self.",

Filmmaking was my gateway to academic research and anthropology in particular. I had taken anthropology courses as an undergraduate, but I lacked the experiences with different communities on which those courses were grounded. Without those encounters with different ways of world-making I was unable to make sense of the theories my professors provided.

When I moved to Bolivia in 2006, driven by a sense that other worlds are possible, I swore off anthropology as a path to understand them. I took up filmmaking, began working with NGOs, and started hanging out with communities that were very different from my own. This “deep hanging out” suggested how some other worlds might be enacted and brought me back to anthropology. During this time, I began working closely with anthropologists. The methods that ethnographers and documentary filmmakers use in the field turned out to be similar. Patience. Deep hanging out. Listening. Care. Attending to the details that speak volumes about people and places.

These collaborations introduced me first to ethnographic practice grounded in lived experiences and then to the bodies of literature and academic debates within the discipline of anthropology. The combination of embodied practice with the critical theoretical approach of my anthropologist colleagues helped us to situate the patterns of social subordination that we witnessed within a broader political context. These experiences prompted me to pursue graduate education, first an MPhil in ethnographic documentary at the University of Manchester, and then a Ph.D. in anthropology at the Centre for Citizenship, Civil Society, and Rule of Law at the University of Aberdeen. In my teaching, I strive to encourage the same kind of project-based learning that inspired me to explore theoretical questions through research grounded in experience.",

Vázquez is co-editor with Sarah D. Wald, Priscilla Solis Ybarra, and Sarah Jaquette Ray of Latinx Environmentalisms: Place, Justice, and the Decolonial (Temple 2019), which won the 2022 MLA Prize for an Edited Collection. Latinx Environmentalisms maps the ways Latinx cultural texts integrate environmental concerns with questions of social and political justice.

His first book Triangulations: Narrative Strategies for Navigating Latino Identity (Minnesota 2011), explores how Latina/o authors in late twentieth-century America employ the coordinates of ideas of self in autobiographical texts to find their way to new, complex identities.

Her research focuses on globalization and Asian literature, Asian American interdisciplinary studies, Vietnamese American literature and culture, and neoliberalism in American transnational literature. She is currently finalizing her contracted academic book, tentatively titled ""Transnational Kinship: Vietnamese American Aesthetics of Relationality in the Neoliberal Peace."" This interdisciplinary book weaves together literary analysis and personal narratives to scrutinize Vietnamese Americans' relationships with Vietnamese nationals, histories of war, colonialism, and US neoliberal empire, and with each other.

Her co-authored book, ""The Making of Little Saigon: Narratives of Nostalgia, (Dis)enchantment, and Aspirations"" (Hamilton Books, 2024), orchestrates the voices of activists, writers, artists, entrepreneurs, and scholars who have inhabited and nurtured Little Saigon, Orange County, California, into a sanctuary for Vietnamese refugees and immigrants in the U.S. From oceanic crossings to forging a new home, every story interweaves and reverberates with a history of pain and beauty, disunity and solidarity, failure, and resilience as the community careens forward into an unknown future. This book is sponsored by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Studies Center and the Pacific Research Institute for Information Systems and Management (PRIISM).

Prior to joining the Department of Critical Race, Gender, & Culture Studies at American University, Dr. Quynh Vo taught composition and literature in the English Department at the University of Hawaiʻi and a graduate course on the transnational representation of Southeast Asia for Graduate Education and Training for Southeast Asian Studies (GETSEA)—a cross-institutional network led by the eight current and recent National Resource Centers (NRCs) on Southeast Asia in the United States. A literary scholar and bilingual educator, Dr. Vo is also interested in cultural and literary theory and criticism, gender studies, critical refugee studies, and translation. Her co-translated anthology, ""Longings: Contemporary Fiction by Vietnamese Women Writers,"" emerges from these intellectual concerns and was published in 2024 by Texas Tech University Press.

Dr. Quynh Vo's writings, both in English and Vietnamese, have appeared in The Los Angeles Review of Books, World Literature Today, Asian Literature and Translation, Journal of Vietnamese Studies, Da Mau, Saigoneer, Peace, Land, Bread, and other venues.

I also follow the postmortem ""lives"" of dead bodies, as the dead become entangled with the living through collective memory, memorialization, and heritage practices.

My main research focuses on Ireland-born persons in the Huntington Anatomical Collection (1893-1921), which is comprised of the remains of persons who died in public institutions, were dissected, and then made into anatomical specimens. Acknowledging these histories of inequality, I use archival and osteological methodologies and draw upon theories of embodiment and materiality to rearticulate their life histories and refocus attention to their personhood. I ask: What were the material and social landscapes that they inhabited in Ireland and New York City? What does the skeletal evidence of health and activity tell us about labor in these places? What meanings did signs of labor and health, visible on their bodies, take within discourses of poverty, citizenship, race, age, and gender? I also articulate this research within the enduring legacies of inequality and race science within the discipline of biological anthropology and with movements to respond to these histories of inequality and violence. This research will be published in a monograph, currently in preparation and under contract with the University of Alabama Press, in the Archaeologies of Restorative Justice series.

My second project more closely follows the post-mortem movements of human remains, from their places of death, to sites of dissection and curation. Starting from the Huntington Collection, I consider the circulation of immigrant bodies more widely within knowledge production practices of early physical anthropology, during an era of eugenics, race science, nativism, and evolving immigration policies that sought to restrict entry. This research considers the enduring material effects of these histories, within collection storerooms, datasets, everyday research practices and methods, and historical memory. By tracing broader histories of collection and the discipline of biological anthropology, this research also considers the future of skeletal collections and bioarchaeological and curatorial ethics. I also draw connections between immigrant experiences in the past with contemporary structural inequality, racialization, and immigration policy.",

O. Woodbine is Associate Professor of Philosophy and Religion and African American Studies at American University in Washington, D.C. He earned a B.A. in Philosophy at Yale University and a Ph.D. in Religious Studies at Boston University. His research examines vital expressions of lived religion and healing, especially among contemporary African American communities in the United States.

His first book, Black Gods of the Asphalt: Religion, Hip-Hop, and Street Basketball, garnered national praise as “a profound narrative of survival [and] self-determination … in this season where black male bodies are under attack.” Covered by The New York Times (“street basketball functions as an outlet of mourning and healing of urban youths”), NPR’s All Things Considered (“invites readers to look at basketball differently … as a sacred space where young black boys go to ‘reclaim their humanity’”), ESPN (“full of colorful tales and haunting heartbreaks”), Boston Magazine (“painful, beautiful, nonfiction debut”), and the National Catholic Reporter (“A powerful and deeply moving work … reveals a world of redemption and hope rarely glimpsed from the outside”), Black Gods was longlisted for the 2017 PEN/ESPN Award for Literary Sports Writing and named one of The Boston Globe’s best books of 2016.

Dr. Woodbine’s second book, Take Back What the Devil Stole: An African American Prophet’s Encounters in the Spirit World, also draws from “lived religion,” womanist theory, and ethnographic studies, to center the healing practices of an African American woman (Donna Haskins) who wrestles with structural inequality in the streets of Boston by inhabiting an alternate dimension she refers to as the “spirit realm.” Both ethnographic and phenomenological, this book explores Donna’s experiences of the supernatural and her sense of multireligious belonging as she blends together Catholic, Black Baptist, and Afro-Caribbean traditions. Devil Stole has received praise from The Christian Century as “a model of ethnographic work that centers the voice of its subject.”

In addition to his academic scholarship, Dr. Woodbine’s research has also contributed to increased awareness of African American religions and healing in the public square. Black Gods was adapted into a stage play, which was performed at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival in South Africa by Dr. Woodbine’s students and at independent schools across the United States. Dr. Woodbine’s research has been featured in an Ad campaign for Dove + Men Care on Black masculinity (2021) and led to consultations for the Netflix film High Flying Bird (2019) and the Museum of the City of New York’s exhibition “City/Game: Basketball in New York” (2020).",

Research Focus: ""Managing and Marketing Organizations in the Creative Economy.""

Creative Economies account for a tremendous share of the global economy and business and management skills are a vital part of the future of these sectors. Creative industries have been defined as those activities which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property. This is achieved through cultural activities such as making pictures, designing objects, telling stories, and staging events. With the addition of technology and management, you create film, broadcasting, the music industry, computer games, fashion, and etc.

Cultural tastes and habits change quickly, which impacts the way creative managers run their businesses and make decisions. Research is conducted on the cities' Business Cluster. Business Clusters are defined as geographic concentrations of interconnected companies, specialized suppliers service providers, firms in related industries, and associated institutions (for example, universities, standards agencies, and trade associations) in particular fields that compete but also co-operate (Porter, 1991). Example cities include Nashville, Austin, Miami, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Washington, D.C, Chicago, New York, New Orleans, San Juan, Cuba, and Taipei, Taiwan.",

He specializes in the study of war crimes documentation and historical atrocities. Sullivan's fieldwork focuses on equipping state and non-state armed groups with a solid understanding of humanitarian law, along with effective methods and best practices for documenting war crimes. In academia, his research, which began during his residency in Ukraine, centers on the 1919 pogroms in Ukraine and Poland, as well as the subsequent pogroms in Rivne (Rovno) and Lutsk during and after the Nazi occupation of Poland.

Since 2022, Sullivan has been actively engaged in advancing rule of law and capacity-building efforts across Southeast Asia. His work has focused on supporting Anti-Money Laundering (AML) programs and delivering Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) training to international Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) in the Greater Mekong region, aimed at bolstering institutional responses to transnational criminal networks. Building on his experience in open-source information gathering and his prior fieldwork in war crimes evidence collection, he is now contributing to the vital documentation of war crimes in active conflict zones, supporting efforts to promote justice and accountability.

From 2014 to 2021, he was seconded by the U.S. Department of State to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. During these seven years, Sullivan held several leadership roles in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kramatorsk, and Lviv. Notably, as Team Leader in Kramatorsk, he oversaw more than 150 staff members monitoring ceasefire violations and coordinating with the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination (JCCC). His team played a key role in high-profile efforts, establishing patrol bases in government-controlled areas like Svitlodarsk and non-government-controlled areas such as Horlivka. Under his leadership, collaboration with the JCCC was crucial in implementing the Minsk Protocol and Memorandum provisions.

From 2010-2013 he served in Kandahar, Afghanistan, with the U.S. Department of State. He initially founded and directed the Kandahar Provincial Reconstruction Program's U.S. Rule of Law program and subsequently served as Director of the Rule of Law program for Regional Platform South.

You can learn more about my work and find links to my publications at meganfinn.com. I am accepting MA and PhD advisees.

I have a number of research projects which are historical and contemporary empirical studies of responsible computing and data governance. My work examines relations among policies, infrastructures, and practices in the production, circulation, and use of data and information. I examine these themes in a book, called Documenting Aftermath: Information Infrastructures in the Wake of Disasters, with MIT Press (October 2018). The book is an examination of how changing public information infrastructures shaped people’s experience of earthquakes in Northern California in 1868, 1906, and 1989 followed by an analysis of the institutions, policies, and technologies that shape today’s postdisaster information landscape. I argue that information orders—complex constellations of institutions, technologies, and practices—influence how we act in, experience, and document events. What I term event epistemologies, constituted both by historical documents and by researchers who study them, explain how information orders facilitate particular possibilities for knowledge.

Before moving to SOC at AU, I was a professor at University of Washington’s Information School. I was a faculty member of the DataLab at the iSchool, and an affiliate of the UW’s eScience Institute, where, as a part of the Data Science Studies group, I co-convened a talk series, “Data Then and Now” from 2019-2021. I was an advisor with my university’s Science, Technology and Society Studies (STSS) program where I have been lucky enough to advise incredible students from Forestry, Law, and Urban Planning. I was lucky enough to supervise Meg Young, now a researcher at Data and Society. I am still an affiliate professor with the University of Washington.

In 2022-2023 I was a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley’s Center for Science, Technology, Medicine, and Society and Stanford’s Department of Communication and HAI. In 2021-2022 I was a Lenore Annenberg and Wallis Annenberg Fellowship in Communication at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. From 2012-2014 I spent two wonderful years as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Microsoft Research New England in Cambridge, MA with the Social Media Research Group.

Ahmed dedicated more than three decades to the Civil Service of Pakistan, the senior-most cadre of the Central Superior Services of Pakistan, where his posts included Commissioner in Balochistan, Political Agent in the Tribal Areas, including Waziristan, and Pakistan High Commissioner to the UK and Ireland.

Ahmed’s expertise has earned high praise around the world. The BBC called him, “The world’s leading authority on contemporary Islam,” and the Saudi Gazette lauded him as, “Perhaps the most influential living authority on contemporary Muslim societies.”

Ahmed’s critically acclaimed projects include academic books, documentaries, plays, poetry, a feature film, and a comic book. Ahmed’s most recent book, Journey into Europe (2018), is the fourth book in a quartet of studies published by Brookings Press examining relations between the West and Islamic world. The book has been featured in multiple summer reading lists and received positive reviews in popular publications, including, The New York Times and the San Francisco Review of Books. The first three books in the quartet, Journey into Islam: The Crisis of Globalization (2007), Journey into America: The Challenge of Islam (2010), and The Thistle and the Drone: How America's War on Terror Became a Global War on Tribal Islam (2013) also received notable media attention. Journey into America and Journey into Europe were accompanied by documentaries of the same name (2009 and 2015).

Prior to the Brookings quartet of studies, Ahmed’s most celebrated projects included the Jinnah Quartet and Living Islam.

Ahmed presented and narrated the six-part BBC TV series Living Islam (1993) and authored the accompanying book of the same name.

In addition to his academic works, Ahmed has produced noteworthy poetry and plays. Ahmed’s poems were broadcast from the Library of Congress in “The Poet and the Poem” podcast series. His plays Noor and The Trial of Dara Shikoh have been staged around the world. He writes a weekly column for the Daily Times, one of Pakistan’s leading newspapers.

Ahmed has remained committed to service throughout his career. His roles include: Trustee, World Faiths Development Dialogue, chaired by Lord George Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury; Charter Member, The Interfaith Coalition on Mosques; Member, International Advisory Board for The Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice at The Queen’s University of Belfast; and Member, Washington Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council.

Ahmed’s esteemed career has earned him a number of awards, including: the Government of Pakistan’s Star of Excellence (Sitara-i-Imtiaz) for academic distinction and Medal of Excellence (Tamgha-i-Imtiaz); the first-ever Purpose Prize alongside Judea Pearl; the inaugural Gandhi Memorial Center Peace Award; the inaugural Award of the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington; Professor of the Year Award for Washington, D.C. by Carnegie Foundation in 2004 ; consistently featured in The Muslim 500: The World’s 500 Most Influential Muslims; being named a 2015 Global Thought Leader by the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute and The Huffington Post’s WorldPost; acknowledgement as a “Notable Alumnus” of SOAS, University of London, and Birmingham University, UK; the 2017 Sir Syed Day Lifetime Achievement Award for excellence in Poetry, Literature, Arts or the Sciences by the Aligarh Muslim University Alumni Association of New Jersey and Pennsylvania; and named the 2017 Scholar/Teacher of the Year of the American University School of International Service, one of the top-ten international relations programs in the US. The National Cathedral in 2005 dedicated an Evensong Service in honor of Ahmed in an unprecedented event led by the Bishop of Washington, D.C., and Senior Rabbi of the Washington Hebrew Congregation.

In the summer of 2018, Ahmed undertook a world tour to introduce his new book starting with Harvard University. He spoke at the Woolf Institute, Cambridge, Chatham House, London, SOAS, London, and The Bradford Literary Festival.

In the first area, on which I have spent more time, I examine the politics, internal dynamics, and patterns of violence of militias, paramilitaries, private military contractors, and drug cartels among others. My work in this area has resulted in two books: The first, On the Fault Line: Race, Class, and the American Patriot Movement (Rowman and Littlefield 2003), tracks the identity politics of the Kentucky State Militia as it experienced rapid growth, internal upheaval, and decline with the arrest of its commander.
The second book, After the Peace: Loyalist Paramilitaries in Post-accord Northern Ireland (Cornell 2007) examines why Loyalist paramilitaries took nearly a decade after the 1998 peace agreement to decommission their weapons and stand down their armed units.
My work on these groups has also appeared in academic journals like Space and Polity and Antipode.

Currently I am working on an NIJ funded project (with colleague Dan Schneider) about cross border cooperation between US and Mexican law enforcement agencies policing drug cartels. This research is in progress.

My second area of focus is on urban politics. Although my research in the above category is interdisciplinary, I was trained as a human geographer, and a few years ago I made a conscious decision to return to my disciplinary roots. Given that I live and work in a large metropolitan area, I decided to look at the major changes ongoing in DC. To that end I am working on a book manuscript (tentatively titled The Politics of Staying Put: Tenant Right to Buy in Washington DC) about a unique law in the District of Columbia--the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act--that allows tenants buy their apartment buildings when their landlord sells it or tries to convert to condominium. My analysis tracks the program's level of success at keeping people in place between 2000 and 2013, a period of rapid gentrification in the District.",

She is a faculty affiliate of three university centers, and is also a fellow at the progressive climate policy think tank, the Climate and Community Institute. Most broadly, she is a scholar of environmental justice, who studies the political economy of land, labor, and ecology in the context of capitalist development. She works primarily on the cities of Bangalore and Washington, D.C., focusing on what she terms ""environmental unfreedoms."" Specifically, she studies how colonial, caste, and racial histories shape housing and land rights, labor politics, and climate and water inequities. She is currently working on two books. The first, The Urbanization of Caste Power: Land, Labor, and Environmental Politics in Bengaluru, is forthcoming with Cambridge University Press. It re-examines the city of Bengaluru through the analytic of caste power, tracing the historical and contemporary production of land dispossession, labor exploitation, and environmental casteism. Through activist narratives and translations of a Kannada-language slum magazine, it also discusses the forms of slum, legal, and union resistance that have challenged these. The second is The Climate of Labor Justice: Planetary Ecologies of Race, Caste, and Capitalism. Training our attention on southern India and the Indian Ocean World and migratory connections between the two regions, the book argues that we rethink the climate crisis as inseparable from a labor crisis stretching from the colonial to contemporary era. It draws on Asian diasporic labor history to show that idioms of freedom, dignity, and self-respect can shape a left, internationalist pro-labor climate justice movement. She is co-author of Corruption Plots: Stories, Ethics, and Publics of the Late Capitalist City (Cornell Press, 2023, Yoda Press 2024), winner of the 2024 Anthony Leeds Book Prize awarded by the Critical Urban Anthropology Association. The book draws on ethnography, film and cultural analysis, to argue, against the grain, that ""corruption talk"" serves as a means for various publics to narrate unequal urban development. It is deployed beyond narrow legal definitions to condemn land grabs, ecologically-risky development, and housing evictions, even as it is used opportunistically to deflect blame onto marginalized others.

He studies the social and political-economic causes of the precarity and suffering of natural-resource-dependent communities. He conducts his research in four inter-linked arenas: decentralization and democratic local government; natural resource tenure and access; distribution along natural resource commodity chains; and household vulnerability in the face of climate change. Ribot uses a political-economy approach drawing on disciplines of sociology, anthropology, political science, political philosophy and geography, and has developed in-situ research-based education programs, called Higher Education through Comparative Research, to train over eighty young scholars in their own countries to conduct in-depth policy research and to translate that research into scholarly writing and policy relevant briefs and seminars. While most of his work has been in Eastern Senegal and he has conducted comparative research across Africa and in Asia and Latin America. Ribot transmits the findings of his research through books, articles, a children’s book, film, policy briefs, sculptures, teaching and lectures.



Since August 2018 he is a professor in the School of International Service at American University. Before coming to AU, he spent the decade from 2008 to 2018 as a professor of Geography, Anthropology and Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois, where he directed the campus-wide Social Dimensions of Environmental Policy program.

Thompson is a historian of social movements and liberal constitutionalism in the Middle East, with a focus on how race and gender relations have been conditioned by foreign intervention and international law. She recently published her third book: How the West Stole Democracy from the Arabs: The Syrian Arab Congress and the Destruction of its Historic Liberal-Islamic Alliance (Atlantic Monthly Press, 2020). It explores how and why Arabs gathered in Damascus after World War I to establish a democratic regime, in contrast to the prevalence of authoritarian-nationalist regimes established elsewhere in the lands of the defeated Ottoman and Habsburg Empires. The book also considers the long-term, negative consequences of the destruction of the Arab democracy, authorized by the Paris Peace Conference and enforced by the new League of Nations.

Thompson is author of two previous books: Justice Interrupted: The Struggle for Constitutional Government in the Middle East (Harvard, 2013) and Colonial Citizens: Republican Rights, Paternal Privilege, and Gender in French Syria and Lebanon (Columbia, 2000), which won two national prizes. She is currently working on two new books. The Deluge: A Memoir of Muslim-Christian Europe and Its Destruction is based on the humorous memoir of a Hungarian-Ottoman who fought alongside Turks in World War I, only to find himself stateless afterward.

He specializes in international relations, political theory, and philosophy. McDonald joins SIS having recently completed a post-doctoral fellowship as a member of the Faculty of International and Political Studies at The Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland.

McDonald’s research broadly examines the relationship between state identity and foreign policy, and particularly Canadian foreign policy in the twenty-first century. He is the author of ""Identity Discourses and Canadian Foreign Policy in the War on Terror"" (2023), part of Palgrave Macmillan's prestigious Canada and International Affairs series. The book investigates the centrality of identity narratives to Canada’s two most paramount foreign policy decisions related to the so-called ‘Global War on Terror:’ the decision to join the US in the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the decision to abstain from the invasion of Iraq in 2003. His book has recently been featured on E-International Relations. Currently, McDonald is completing an article exploring the Justin Trudeau government’s recent embrace of feminist foreign policy principles and its implications regarding NATO's response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

McDonald has received numerous teaching awards for his International Relations courses, most recently having taught Gender and IR, Grand Strategy, and Alliance Diplomacy and the Global War on Terror.

She is also a Distinguished Fellow at the Stimson Center, where she heads the Food Security Program. Her frontline experience as a policy maker on conflict and stabilization efforts drove her interest in connecting the role of food in conflict, resulting in the creation of Conflict Cuisine®: An Introduction to War and Peace Around the Dinner Table, an interdisciplinary course she teaches at the School of International Service at American University in Washington, DC. As an Adjunct Professor leading this innovative curriculum, Johanna challenges her students to explore new ways of looking at diplomacy, conflict resolution, and civic engagement to understand how food, as a form of Soft Power, can drive these issues in the 21st Century. In establishing this link between food and conflict, Johanna developed a new interdisciplinary platform examining why food is central to survival and resilience in conflict zones.


Her groundbreaking work on food in conflict zones is derived from her distinguished career as a practitioner and policymaker in the United States government, the United Nations and the World Bank. Her experiences working as an expert on conflict and stabilization efforts from Haiti to Rwanda led her to this effort to connect food with conflict. She also is highly regarded as a regional expert on Latin America and the Caribbean, with extensive field experience in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, Central America, Colombia and Brazil. Most recently, she has focused on the ongoing food crisis in Venezuela. Her work on civil-military relations in the region contributed to a new approach to engaging members of the armed forces and civilians to promote dialogue about democratization and civil society at the time of many transitions to democracy. Through her wide-ranging career in international affairs, Johanna Mendelson Forman has built a reputation for addressing longstanding issues with new perspectives and innovative ideas. By recognizing the nexus between food, war, and civic engagement, she has become one of the leading voices in the emerging movement of Social Gastronomy.


At the Stimson Center she worked as a Senior Advisor to the Managing Across Boundaries project that explored the impact of transnational issues on public policy in the Americas. During her tenure at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the Americas Program she worked on United States policies toward the conflict in in Colombia and related issues such as Taiwan’s diminishing influence in the Americas. She also served as an advisor to the Center’s Program on Crisis, Conflict and Cooperation.


During her tenure at the UN Foundation, where she was Program Director for Peace, Security and Human Rights, she coordinated programming and grants in that area to organizations in the United Nations and non-governmental organizations, with an emphasis on human rights, gender equality, and conflict prevention.


Today her research focuses on gastrodiplomacy and social gastronomy, the use of food as a means of social impact and investment to communities at risk. As a participant in the Livelihoods In Food Entrepreneurship Project (LIFE), a consortium of organizations under the Center for Private and International Enterprise, she is managing the gastrodiplomacy component of the program to support Syrian refugees in Turkey who are using food as a tool for social integration. She has also co-edited a cookbook of recipes contributed by refugees which will be published in 2019.


She has written extensively on security-sector reform in conflict states and economic development. Her writings have appeared in a wide-range of publications including the Miami Herald, the Washington Post, U.S. News and World Report, Americas Quarterly, The Globalist, World Politics Review, VOXXI, Estadao, and El Universal. She frequently appears on national media including National Public Radio, Univision, postwar societies, gender and conflict, and the role of the United Nations in peace operations. She frequently appears on national media including National Public Radio, Univision, and CNN. Johanna has lectured on food-related topics at the Smithsonian Resident Associates Program, Johns Hopkins University Bologna Campus, New York University’s Washington Program, and at the United States Pavilion of the 2015 World Expo in Milan, Italy. She has also appeared at MAD, Food Tank, YEDI 2019, and other food-center programs that bring academics and practitioners together.


Mendelson Forman is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She is also a member of Les Dames d ’Escoffier.

As part of the inaugural University of Illinois System Distinguished Faculty Recruitment Program, Hopson served as catalyst in re-envisioning the Evaluation unit in the department, developing externally funded partnerships with and for PhD students, and leading assistant professor development efforts.

Hopson received his doctorate from the Curry School of Education, University of Virginia, with major concentrations in educational evaluation, anthropology, and policy, and sociolinguistics. He was awarded a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIH) postdoctoral fellowship at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University.

Currently he is affiliated with the School of Health, Victoria University-Wellington (Aotearoa New Zealand), is Editor of the Studies in Educational Ethnography Book Series, Emerald Publishers, and Co-Editor of Educational Policy as/in Practice: Critical Cultural Studies, Information Age Book Series.

Central to Hopson’s research agenda over the last 25 years are questions that: 1) analyze and address the differential impact of education and schooling on marginalized and underrepresented groups in diverse global nation states; and 2) seek solutions to social and educational conditions in the form of alternative paradigms, epistemologies, and methods for the way the oppressed and marginalized succeed and thrive despite circumstances and opportunities that suggest otherwise. He has co-authored and co-edited 11 books, including Theories Bridging Ethnography and Evaluation: Making Transformative, Intersectional, and Comparative Connections (Emerald, 2024); Culturally responsive inquiry in education: Improving research, evaluation, and assessment (Harvard Education Press, 2022); Tackling wicked problems in complex ecologies: The role of evaluation (Stanford University Press, 2018); New directions in educational ethnography: Shifts, problems, reconstruction (Emerald, 2016); Power, voice, and the public good: Schooling and education in global societies (Elsevier, 2008); and others.

Hopson’s cumulative work is driven by quests to: a) understand the role of language as a harbinger of social and educational change, especially in post-apartheid and postcolonial nation states that wrestle with the tensions and opportunities of democracy and freedom; and b), emphasize the transformative possibility of developing mechanisms that promote educational and social equity through the development of communities of practice in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary ways to broaden participation, inclusion, and diversity for those often forgotten and underserved in schools, community, social systems, and the larger society.
