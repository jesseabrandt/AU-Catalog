Each generation has tailored its stories to its particular time, place, and agenda, resulting in many different versions of Cook, his ships and crew, and the impact of his visits on native peoples throughout the Pacific. This course explores the story of Captain Cook yet again, informed by the latest scholarly insights and research. It strives to understand, as much as possible, the perspective and agency of native peoples throughout the Pacific who suddenly encountered these strange white men on massive wooden ships. The course examines histories and culture before Cook, how they interpreted the arrival of Europeans, how they interacted with them (and why), and what happened to them after Cook left. Though the chief focus is on Cook’s three voyages (1768-71, 1772-75, 1776-80), the course also examines phenomena such as political alliances, trade, sex and disease, kidnapping and slavery, perceptions of savagery and paradise, competing systems of property rights, the high drama of first encounters, and the modern-day legacies and fates of the many places and peoples once touched by Cook’s ships.AU Core Habits of Mind: Socio-Historical Inquiry.  | ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,HIST,274,Captain Cook and the Pacific ,(3),3,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This process of producing and presenting knowledge is called inquiry. All inquiry begins with a problem, puzzle, or question and seeks to address, solve, or answer it in a way that is compelling for audiences. Different traditions of inquiry approach this process in different ways, fitting questions to methods according to different principles and structuring the process in order to achieve different outcomes. At the same time, traditions of inquiry are not entirely exclusive; they are, rather, engaged in an ongoing scholarly dialogue, and feature subtle overlaps and complementarities. In this course AU Honors students navigate this complexity while formulating plans for their own research, creative, or professional activities. What they learn in this course feeds directly into their other classes, Honors colloquia, and capstone. Students also take these lessons with them into the world beyond the university. The course helps students grapple with the difficulties of identifying a strong question to inaugurate a process of inquiry, how to refine the question in dialogue with different research traditions, and then how to identify and locate the right material and methods for answering the question.

Second, how a sustainable approach to business may enable firms to better manage a wide variety of external risks is discussed. For sustainable strategies to be effective, however, they must be core to the firm’s business. The strategies must be based on a company’s core competencies so that the strategy is meaningful, targeted, and positively impacts firm performance and the social issues in question.

The course covers essential aspects of how people speak, both in terms of the physical production of the sounds of speech, and in terms of different languages and dialects. Students explore what the sounds of language mean: how sounds convey both communicative meaning (such as the difference between pen and pin in English, or caro and carro in Spanish) and social meaning related to identity and stereotypes.

It tackles the question of how environmental justice intersects with social justice, especially along the axes of gender, race, sexuality, and disability. It begins with classic environmental literature, in order to interrogate the traditional (and yet changing) referents of the term “nature,” from animals and wilderness, to urban parks and chic products. It then explores the ways in which marginalized populations (especially women, people of color, queer people, and people with disabilities) have not only borne the brunt of environmental devastation and climate change, but have also historically led environmental justice movements around the globe. Throughout the course, students dig deeper to understand the conceptual underpinnings of environmental and social injustices. In particular, philosophical tools are used to critically assess how the notion of “natural” has been used to describe forms of life that are socially naturalized (e.g., white, cisheterosexual, able-bodied people) and similarly, how the notion of “unnatural” has been used to describe the socially marginalized (e.g., the queer, the immigrant, the impaired, etc.). Drawing on the traditions of ecofeminism, race and environmental justice, queer ecology, and disability theory, students learn that a robust environmental ethics must reimagine “nature” itself to address degrading ecosystems alongside social hierarchies and marginalization. Students deepen their knowledge of intersectional justice not only across human communities, but within a more-than-human world.

Canonical works such as the Confessions of Augustine and Rousseau, Descartes’ vivid first-person account of his quest for certainty, Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological investigation of embodied experience, and Sartre’s existentialist study of “the gaze” have historically placed narrative investigation of the nature of human experience at the center of the philosophical project. One way to understand the distinctive contribution of feminist philosophers and theorists of the late twentieth century is to see that body of work as telling another side of the story, one that radically recasts conceptions of embodiment, identity, ethics, and the body politic.

Among the most popular topics of these persistent narratives are the struggles and successes of political actors in ancient and medieval India, whose efforts underlie the ethics impinging on the most pressing societal issues affecting South Asia today. In order to understand these modern political ethical problems better, this course identifies their ideological roots by delving into collections of stories that represent the politically charged genres of epic, allegory, and parody. In addition to examining the contents of these literary texts closely and situating them in their sociohistorical contexts, students consider how the texts’ implicit teachings continue to resonate even now on the Indian subcontinent and its surrounding areas, where political unity and stability in any respect can be precarious.AU Core Habits of Mind: Socio-Historical Inquiry.  | ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,RELG,245,Stories of South Asia ,(3),3,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How are religious texts interpreted across the globe? Why do religions seem to change over time? How have religious communities both supported and opposed societal structures like economics, politics, and war? What role does religion play in healthcare, education, and art?

Disparate regional realities are addressed as the course focuses on the political, social (including race, gender, and ethnicity), and economic dimensions of migration to the European Union, the United States and Canada, and intra-regional migrations in Asia and the Pacific. The course explores the policies and institutions established by nation-states to deal with immigration and refugee crises, the economic impact of migration on both sending and receiving states, and the dominant theories on migration phenomena. The course fosters critical thinking on complex issues by having students produce a series of reflective essays and a final paper, as well as group presentations on these issues.

The course pushes beyond an intersectionality practice that “includes differences” and moves students toward practices of intersectionality that deploy knowledge of subjugated social groups with the intention of challenging and changing interrelated systems of social inequality.

The first unit synthesizes core theoretical frameworks and concepts used to understand immigrant integration, including assimilation, racialization and racial formation, whiteness, citizenship, and nativism. The second unit centers structural explanations of immigrant integration, examining how immigration policy and other social institutions intersect with race, ethnicity, and other categories of difference to privilege some immigrant groups while disadvantaging others. The third unit counters dominant understandings of immigrant integration as a process with immigrants as passive recipients, exploring the profound ways in which immigration continues to reconfigure social constructions of race and ethnicity and social institutions in the United States.

At the heart of these issues are enduring patterns of power, privilege, and inequality, embedded in social, cultural, economic, political and global hierarchies, including those around race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, social-economic status, and nationality. Through provocative readings and films, student-led facilitation, and individual and group-based projects oriented towards addressing structural inequalities, this course considers when, where, how and why matters of health and issues of rights intersect; historical influences on present-day issues at the nexus of health and rights; and the role of various institutions that inform the experience of health and rights. It further considers global power influences on issues of health and rights across borders as well as the differential experience of health and rights for historically marginalized populations throughout the world.

Since colonial times, the indigenous peoples of Latin America have been discriminated and suffered oppression. Nineteenth century independence did not bring about substantial changes but rather a continuity in political, social, and economic structures of power. Resistance has also shaped most of the indigenous communities and the way they have advanced in their societies. This course seeks to understand the historical development of these processes.

Spatial data analysis concerns data that are correlated by location and relies upon the assumption that objects closer together in space (e.g., geographical location) will most likely have similar responses. The course provides an introduction to graphical and quantitative methods for the analysis of spatial data. Emphasis is on lattice data (also known as areal data or aggregated data), however modeling of geostatistical data and point patterns are discussed. Topics include spatial regression, clustering and cluster detection, simulation methods, variograms, autocorrelation, and additional spatial methods. Students gain experience with spatially correlated data in applying these techniques using geographic information system (GIS) and spatial analytical software to address research questions in a wide variety of fields including sociology, public health, and environmental sciences.Crosslist: STAT-628 .

Canonical works such as the Confessions of Augustine and Rousseau, Descartes’ vivid first-person account of his quest for certainty, Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological investigation of embodied experience, and Sartre’s existentialist study of “the gaze” have historically placed narrative investigation of the nature of human experience at the center of the philosophical project. One way to understand the distinctive contribution of feminist philosophers and theorists of the late twentieth century is to see that body of work as telling another side of the story, one that radically recasts conceptions of embodiment, identity, ethics, and the body politic. This course focuses on feminist approaches to enduring philosophical questions, to which is added the larger question of difference not limited to that of gender or sex.Crosslist: PHIL-416 .  | ",preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=22&coid=110167,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PHIL,616,Feminist Philosophy ,(3),3,3,NA,PHIL-416 ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
